# 🪴 Soil-Humidity-Sensor-


## 🌱 Overview and how it works 
The soil humidity sensor measures electrical resistance through inserting two probes into the soil and then sends the current. More water in soil results in lower resistance where as less water has a higher resistance. 

## Circuit Setup:
Use an Arduino for the sensor to work and copy the code.
